- 👋 Hi, I’m @dneuschulz
- 👀 I’m interested in techology, literature (classic and modern literary fiction, as well as fantasy fiction).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about the Middle Ages and Middle English. And Spanish.
- 💞️ Not looking to collaborate here, on my "personal" git account. Look for my collaborative handiwork in my corporate life...elsewhere.
- 📫 You can maybe reach me at [fourth letter of the alphabet]neuschulz[atsign]aol[dott]com
